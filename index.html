N'Golo Kanté (born 29 March 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Premier League club Chelsea 

and the France national team.[4] Considered by many to be one of the world's best midfielders, 
Kanté is widely praised for his workrate and defensive contribution.[5][6]
Kanté made his senior professional debut with Boulogne in 2012, appearing as a substitute in one Ligue 2 match,
 and played an entire season in the third division the following year. After that he joined Ligue 2 side Caen on a free transfer,
 finished third and won promotion to Ligue 1. He stayed with the club for one more year.

In 2015, Kanté joined Leicester City for a fee worth £5.6 million and was integral to their maiden Premier League victory. 
The following year, he joined Chelsea for a fee worth £32 million and again won the league,
 making him the first outfield player to win consecutive English league titles with different clubs since Eric Cantona in 1992 and 1993.[7]
 He has also won the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, an FA Cup, the UEFA Europa League, and the UEFA Champions League.

Kanté made his senior international debut for France in 2016 and was included in the squad that finished runners-up at the 2016 European Championship.
 In 2017 Kanté was named the French Player of the Year, a first for a player from the Premier League in seven years, and 12 months later was a key member of the 2018 FIFA World Cup winning squad.

Justin Drew Bieber (/biːbər/; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer. 
He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008,
 gaining recognition with the release of his debut EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.[4]

Bieber's debut album, My World 2.0 (2010), 
debuted atop the Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[5]
 The album also contained the internationally successful single "Baby", which became the highest certificated single of all time in the US.
 [6] His second album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), was the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200,[7] 
 while his third album, Believe (2012), saw experimentation with dance-pop and mature themes.[8] Following Believe, 
 Bieber's public image went through a drastic change through various controversies and legal issues during 2013 and 2014,[9]
 leading to Rolling Stone dubbing him "Bad Boy" on their March 2014 issue.[10] However, 
 starting in 2016, he has been setting his priorities on repairing his public image, by taking responsibility for his past wrongdoings[11]
 and focusing on his mental health.
 [12] In February 2016, GQ released an article about Bieber's commitment to "reintroduce" himself.[13]

His fourth album, Purpose, was released in 2015. It was preceded by "Where Are Ü Now", 
a collaboration with Jack Ü, which saw Bieber explore EDM,[14] and win the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.[15] 
Purpose produced three number-one singles: "What Do You Mean?", "Love Yourself", and "Sorry". 
Bieber diversified on later collaborations, with "Cold Water", "Let Me Love You", "I'm the One", 
and "I Don't Care" reaching the top five in the U.S., while his remix to "Despacito" tied the then-record for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, 
and "10,000 Hours" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[16]
 His fifth album, Changes was released in 2020, while his sixth album, Justice (2021), produced the US number-one single "Peaches".[17]

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 150 million records sold,
 Bieber is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for "Baby",
 "Sorry" and "Despacito". He has received numerous accolades, including 23 Guinness World Records, two Grammy Awards
 , a record 21 MTV Europe Music Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, two Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 
 and a Latin Grammy Award.[18] Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes'
 list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[19]

Outside music, Bieber's marriage to Hailey Baldwin has received considerable media attention,
 and he also starred in the concert films Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) and Justin Bieber's Believe (2013),
 while his personal issues were chronicled in the documentary series Justin Bieber: Seasons (2020).
